TODO:

 - need to check for different number types (binary, hex, dec), not only registers.
 - add support for multiple lines (however many) + branch and goto
	 - read the entire input first, then divide into lines (stringstream?)
	 - recognise goto markers, store location and implement goto
	 - later add conditional branching (simple at first, so NE and EQ)
	 - add support for flags (needed for conditional branching)
	 - use CPSR register for conditions
